# Quantum-Circuit-Optimiser
* A neat software tool that takes high level quantum algorithms and compiles them into optimised circuits for specific quantum hardware architectures

This project aims to implement a software tool that can compile quantum algorithms into circuits with the intended usecase being quantum hardware architectures.
We make use of (Qiskit)[https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit], as it allows for advanced optimisation techniques that ensure efficiency as complexity scales.
